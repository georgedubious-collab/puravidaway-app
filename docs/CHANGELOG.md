- 2026-10-13 — Claude — Merged Architecture.md, Database-Schema.md, Route-Pricing.md and the
  Gemini master spec into `docs/PROJECT.md` as the single source of truth; corrected it to the
  real repo state (no admin.html; index.html JS truncated; Phase 1 is a design mock, not
  completed). Added `CLAUDE.md` (builder rules), `GEMINI.md` + `.gemini/styleguide.md` (reviewer
  rules) and this changelog. Decision recorded: rebuild on Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase
  (PROJECT.md §2), Claude as primary builder with Gemini as PR reviewer (§10).
